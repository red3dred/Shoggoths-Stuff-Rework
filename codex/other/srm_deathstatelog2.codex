"Butterfly Lung : 
A strange alien organ that reminds me of a butterfly. It imbues my breath with a sweet pollen taste as it flaps rhythmically within my chest.",

"Queen Umvorax's Brain : 
The brain of a queen who was obessed by material wealth. She practiced strange rituals to suffuse her body with gold and other precious ores. Her brain became saturated with gold.",

"Bruised Tissue Mass : 
A bruised and swollen organ that vaguely resembles a heart. It has somehow not only survived some unforgiving blunt trauma, but has been strengthened by the ordeal.",

"Blinking Spleen : 
A vile looking organ with an eye growing out of its surface. It gazes at me sympathetically."
