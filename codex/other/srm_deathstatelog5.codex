"Tumerichan's Lungs : 
A sorceror and a spice merchant, Tumerichan was a legendary traveler of the outer realms. His life's work dealing in exotic trade goods left his lungs saturated and stained with psychoactive essence.",

"Aggravating Brain : 
A bizarre brain with a mind of its own (albeit a weak one). It whispers inside my skull. I can feel my magic abilities refocus on power over speed.",

"The Hungry Heart : 
A voracious thing that looks like it could devour a host from the inside out. It grins its teeth when I hold it close to my body.",

"Brutal Gug Stomach : 
A vile organ from a mighty gug champion. I feel it twisting violently inside of me."
