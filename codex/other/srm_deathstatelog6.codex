"Brain from Afar : 
A bizarre brain with a mind of its own (albeit a weak one). A small pineal gland reaches out on an extended tendril from within its fleshy coils.",

"The Blueblood Hungry Heart : 
A desperately hungry thing born of power and privilege. I fear it may overcome me in time.",

"Biomechanical Gut : 
A reeking, writhing stomach reinforced with mechanical components. Dual pistons blast out a foul spray at any who oppose me."
