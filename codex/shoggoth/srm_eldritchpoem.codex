"    Our bodies are different
    Our needs are different
    Our selves are different
	
	Our food is different
    Our science is different
    Our weapons are different
	
    Our souls are different
    Our minds are different
    Our spirits are different
	
    Maybe you think we're no different
	Than the many others through space and time
    But no matter the thoughts, we will always be seen as different"
