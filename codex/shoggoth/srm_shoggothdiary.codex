"Day 1
I have escaped His grasp. I fleed to the physical realm, where I have taken an unusual form.",

"Day 6
I have found an establishment floating about in the void of space. I will hide in it's parameters, for the moment. Once I find someone guillible enough, I shall take their possessions for my true escape.",

"Day 23
I was on the verge of obtaining the proper equipment for my departure, but a mistake on my part attracted the security, requiring me to go back into hideout. Another similar opportunity will be rare.",

"Day 78
I have taken the property of a floran's crumbly spaceship. While it is in poor state, my flesh has absorbed it to transform it into a proper vessel. Large enough to house us, we fare through space together from now on."
